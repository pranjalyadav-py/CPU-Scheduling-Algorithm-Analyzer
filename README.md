# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Analyzer


## Overview

The CPU Scheduling Algorithm Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to compare various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides a platform to analyze algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and more.

## Features

- **Algorithm Comparison**: Analyze the performance of different CPU scheduling algorithms.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly interface for inputting process burst times and analyzing algorithm performance.
- **Implemented Algorithms**: Includes implementations of FCFS, SJF, RR, and other commonly used scheduling algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Standard Python libraries

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm-Analyzer.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd cpu-scheduling-analyzer

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
